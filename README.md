**Career Profile**: Throughout my 5+ years of professional career and 3 years of a student research assistant, I had the opportunity to develop a unique set of skills that has well-grounded my understanding of software development from prototypical to pre-series development. I have supplemented my software-development skills with sound conceptual and practical knowledge that I obtained from various short courses and degrees, such as Certified Professional for Software Architecture (CSPA-F), Udacity Sensor Fusion, and Udacity Computer Vision. Combining experience in software development, integration in an industry environment, and a solid understanding of mathematical and conceptual foundations, I am offering potential employers the freedom to solve wide range of problems in their software stack.

I have yet to figure out how to keep technology out of my personal life. I follow cppcon regularly and some of my favorite speaker's work inspires me a lot. Some of the veterans in C++ which I follow: Herb Sutter, Micheal Wong, Fedor Pikus, Jason Turner, Andrei Alexandrescu. I like to read books, articles and webinars on the latest programming models and ML/AI in general. In my spare time I watch documentaries and listen to podcasts on history, science, and politics. The rest of my time outside of work is consumed by my two lovely daughters currently under the age of 5 and doing fitness training.
