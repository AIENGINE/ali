**Career Profile:**

Throughout my **5\+**  years of professional career and  **3**  years of a student research assistant, I had the opportunity to develop a unique set of skills that has well-grounded my understanding of software development from prototypical to pre-series development. I have supplemented my software-development skills with sound conceptual and practical knowledge that I obtained from various short courses and degrees, such as Professional Software Architecture CSPA, Udacity Sensor Fusion, and Udacity Computer Vision. Combining experience in software development, integration in an industry environment, and a solid understanding of mathematical and conceptual foundation, I am offering potential employers the freedom to solve wide range of problems in their software stack.

Skills and Technologies

**In Product Integration with HKMC as client:**

- Co-developed a code generation pipeline for the entire EDR/DSSAD project in accordance with MISRA C compliance.
- Implemented common design patterns and LRU cache that increased the model parsing performance by 10-fold.
- Actively supported client and team with requirement analysis and software requirement break down creating architecture.

**In Customer Program with BMW as client:**

- Co-lead the team to become the leading cross-functional team in the lane fusion area in defining lane fusion ground-truth, the GT is named after the team's name.
- Actively supported the team to have the reference CI-pipeline the BWM autonomous driving project to achieved both stable open and close loop pipeline (with offline data and with BMW autonomous driving simulator).

I have yet to figure out how to keep technology out of my personal life. Anyway, I follow cppcon regularly and some of my

favorite speaker's work inspires me a lot. Some of the veterans in C++: Herb Sutter, Micheal Wong, Fedor Pikus,

Jason Turner, Andrei Alexandrescu. I like to read books, articles on programming, ml in general and history. Rest of my time outside

of work is consumed by my two lovely daughters currently under the age of 5.
